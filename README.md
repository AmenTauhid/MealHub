# Inspiration

As students coming from all different backgrounds, we have all experienced that pang of hunger and the multiple ensuing trips to the fridge and pantry, opening and closing the door because "nothing is there" but we're hoping something could appear. Feeding yourself is tough, especially if you're new to cooking and grocery shopping, and we wanted to help make it easier.

# What it does

MealHub is a service that helps create a personalized meal plan just for you and your needs. Just tell us your dietary restrictions, the cuisines you love, and what days you think you have time to cook, and we'll provide you with a meal plan for the week and a shopping list so you know exactly how much to buy for what. No more spoiled leftovers!

You can take MealHub's suggestions as is or switch things around at any point in time by adding meals, swapping them out, or getting a whole new randomized meal plan. And if you find you loved anything you cooked and tried, you can save those recipes for future reference and plans!

# How we built it

MealHub is a full-stack application built with React.js and Tailwind in the frontend and a MongoDB database. The two are connected with a Python Flask API. MealHub uses the Spoonacular API to find recipes from the web. We leveraged the strength of TempoLabs to speed up front-end development as well as the Python libraries and DBMS provided by MongoDB Atlas for a secure and reliable database perfect for our application's needs.
